		//now this new pop has all the attributes of its predecessor and now we can also add unique attributes of its own in the class

		//here basically the method that is being  passed as an inheritance to the class of a designated requirement we can modify that method in that class 
		
//		pop1 pop = new pop1();

		//abstract keyword in java
		
		//this allows us to stop using a class its will not allow the instantiate the class if its too abstract or plain
		//for example you want a car so you will go and ask for a car with a specific model not going to buy a car that is simple just a transport
		
		//so if we use the keyword abstract we can't create a class 
		
//		Vechicle vehicle = new Vehicle();
		
		//here we have created a instance called vehicle
		
		//but if we use the abstract we can't create it
		
		//Cartop car1 = new Cartop();
		
		//so both car is the child of vehicle so it doesn't make any sense 
		
		//so we will not let the option of creating a instance with the vehicle 
		//Vechicle vehicle = new Vehicle();//now its not possible 
		
		//abstract can also be used for method for example if we use a abstract in the abstract class we won't be able to use the body in that class
		
		//but we can use it in the other class and then override it 
		
		//now
		//car1.go();//this will now work
		
		//Access modifiers in java
		
		//(they are public ,protected,protected ,and the default is none)
		
		
		
		//for this we need to create packages in the project file 
		
		//they are basically a collection of classes
		
		
		//encapsulation
		//its a method of hiding or private the attributes of a class 
		//and can only be accessed by special method getter and setter method
